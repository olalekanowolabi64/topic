"Just an update on my previous post. Had my first Cyclophosphamide infusion on Monday, 4 days ago. First 2 days felt OK, just a little quizy at times, they give you anti sickness pills in case you need them. Metoclopramide. Last couple of days felt very tired and breathless, some stomach ache and acute anxiety. Been resting most of the time. Will it get worse with subsequent infusions or will my body get used to it? Thank you for baby comments."

"Dear All,
Today I spent the Day with my Mother.... To begin with we attended a, fairly short, Church Service. Thereafter she 'did a few errands' before we went back, to her place, for some lunch.... Crucially I had Two Large Rolls, absolutely 'stuffed', with ham & pickle- complete with a large mug of tea.
Afterwards we both went Shopping, mainly for my mum- I play Donkey (with the heavy load(s)). I did buy myself a New Electric Razor, with a Very Good Saving Indeed (about ¬£50), in Boots.
After a trip into 'Savers', were my Mum bought quite a Lot- I got some cans, of fruit drink too- I was Bursting BOTH Ways!
With the Public Toilets far, too far away, AND Knowing the Stores 'Policy' of using theirs's..... well erm......Out IT ALL Came, right were I was Standing!
Fortunately I WAS 'Wearing a 'Pad', so No Real Harm Done...... but it WAS a 'Soggy/ Smelly walk back to her car. Out came the plastic sheets and I was Dropped Home! The shopping I will 'Pick Up' Later.
I have just Ordered a Take Away, as my Hair is Drying, from the Shower- since my Shopping is STILL in Mum's Car!
Maybe, next time- assuming there is one!- I will only eat ONE Roll........

"I‚Äôm pretty shocked tonight. I‚Äôve been quite ill this year, spent some time in hospital, had a few trips to a and e, had multiple outpatient appointments over the last few months, my fear throughout was contracting covid when being so unwell and omicron rates were so high. I have to say that through that I was so impressed with the hospitals strict covid policies around mask wearing and precautions in place and have so far managed to avoid it.
However, I had to take my daughter to a & e today, what an awful experience, no one on the door anymore checking for covid symptoms, no requirement to wear masks, absolutely packed in there, 5 hour waiting time to see a doctor, full of people coughing, never felt so vulnerable. People clearly with covid symptoms waiting with the rest of us. Just a sign on the door saying please wear a mask if you have covid symptoms. 1 in 20 they believe have covid and mask wearing not being enforced in hospitals anymore. How on earth do they expect it not to spread like wild there.
I‚Äôm just shocked, it‚Äôs as if people like us just don‚Äôt matter, next time I need to go to hospital in an emergency I‚Äôm certainly not walking into a&e and putting myself through that.
Sorry that‚Äôs my rant, hope everyone‚Äôs ok."

I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?
For those with an interest - published June 2022 twitter.com/j2scott50/statu...
"Tested Positive - Got up yesterday felt a bit heady, ran my normal test and OMG - Positive. Rang my consultants admin they completed form and contacted yesterday by a snotty woman from NHS who didn‚Äôt have a clue about Vasculitis or GPA and the potential of getting seriously ill while on Rituximab. Finally she agreed to submit a prescription to the Hospital who are supposed to contact me today regarding anti viral treatment. Symptoms only slight at the mo pretty much the same as yesterday but waiting for the storm to come. Wife still negative. We were in a hotel for a few days, a horrible family were staying there, dirty kids in pyjamas at breakfast, coughing everywhere, I moved but it may have been too late. Just shows how easy it is to get it. Take care everybody."
Hi there from Canada looking for advice as newly diagnosed with systemic anca vasculitis at 52 yrs young. Lonely journey with little to no direction from doctors as rare. Start 1st cyclophosphamide Iv therapy in 2 days and on prednisone 60 mg daily. Advice? Tips?
"I recently asked for and received great support from the group concerning getting medical clearance for dental work, a crown/cleaning due to mtx, rituximab, prednisone. Rheumy said to get clearance from GP. Two DIFFERENT doctors from the clinic responded. One prescribed amoxicillin prior to dental work. One said not necessary. Dentist said get med clearance in writing. Went to GP clinic with dentist's medical clearance form. This GP said NO dental work other than cleaning and to take amoxicillin prior. (I fully understand the need for antibiotics.) SURPRISE: No cavity filling could be done due to Prolia shot given by rheumy Oct 2021 - the same day prescribed prednisone 20 mg. A DEXA Scan done later the same week scored no osteoporosis. No Prolia or osteoporosis medication prescribed since the Oct 2021 shot/DEXA scan. Have others experienced this Prolia/jaw issue? How long before dental work can be done? It has been since Oct 2021, are the Prolia effects gone? (Prednisone 5 mg since March 2022. Today is dose #30 mtx 20 mg, had two rituximab infusions in June. Trying to achieve remission.) Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
shortly before the Jubilee Weekend I received, a Fifth 'Invitation' to have a COVID Jab. I questioned this, with the 119 Helpline, and Yes- since it's now 'Over Three Months' since my last Jab- I do need another one. Ok this IS Contradicting some previous advice, but still. ""Can have this Done at a Local Pharmacy"" I asked ""Oh yes 'Fine' if they will Do it"" came the reply.
So I went into the Pharmacy, near to where I used to live- the one that had Agreed to 'Jab' me....... they had Run Out Of Vaccine! ""We should have a New Stock soon, within two/ three weeks..........

"Hi
I have been diagnosed with Vasculitis now for just over a year and I am still taking about twenty odd tablets per day and I know everyone says it‚Äôs going to take years to get right but‚Ä¶
I was sitting down yesterday when my wife said oh my god what have you done. I looked down and my arm was bleeding in two places. No cuts, no scratches or knocks. Normally I have these blood vessels burst under the skin but this time they have burst straight through the skin! Consultant says that the steroids have made my skin thin.
Whatever next???

"I have been on prednisolone for over 13 years now and I can't seem to get down. I have been told by my consultant, Mr Hughes , following a scan two years ago, that I had a residual amount of vasculitis/ giant cell arteritis in my system and I had to reduce my pred. I also had paid privately, two years ago, to speak to Prof. Dasgupta who said after 11 years of prednisolone I was definitely suffering from prednisolone toxicity and it was imperative that I got down to at least 7.5 mgs. Two years later I am worse off and seem stuck around 14 mgs. I was on 12mgs when I spoke to Prof. Gasgupta
I keep trying to drop by 0.5mgs every two weeks and have done this so many times. I get down to 10.5/11mgs and then it all goes wrong and I get my usual symptoms of tiredness, headache, light headness and generally feeling unwell. These have always been my symptoms no matter what I have tried. Of late when I get a bad spell I try and sit at 1mg above where I have just been when I got the relapse. My thinking is I don't have an illness it's just too much prednisolone in my body therefore just wait until your body adjusts. I have now been at 13.5 mgs for 9 days and I am still feeling rotten. Interestingly I did get down to 8.5mgs some years ago and my original symptoms of polymyalgia started returning i.e. sore thighs and neck etc. I had initially been diagnosed with polymyalgia for two years and that then morphed into giant cell arteritis.
If you read this far then thanks for reading. Any thoughts most welcome!!"
"To the 3 people that responded to my original post, thank you. The case review was at best a complete failure and waste of my time and gas money. Never mind the stress before, during, and after. I had emailed the 8 sets of lab work & tests including the two done last month. I called June 3 to ensure they were there. A nurse (?) said they were and she ""was looking at them"". On Monday, June 6 the ""specialist"" I had the appointment with, the head of the department with 38 (!) years experienced COULD NOT FIND THE LAB WORK. I sat in disbelief. I waited 4 months and drove 3 hours, one way, to this appointment. The gastroenterology, ENT, dermatology, retina specialist, lung MRIs, podiatry, cardiology reports I brought with me were casually thumbed through (not read, just glanced at). She handed the papers back to me, never copying them or even reading them. She said, "" You have ANCA vasculitis and diffuse scleroderma. You need a sural nerve biopsy"". That was it, no suggestions, no insights, she was a worthless time sucking doctor. I drove the 3 hours home just stopping once to cry. Then I got my act together and finished the drive home. Sural nerve biopsies are not recommended ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl.... I will never allow one to be performed on me. Never. I am completely lost. There is no medical help available for a patient with ANCA-associated vasculitis and diffuse scleroderma. Please, do not suggest another doctor. This major teaching hospital was considered the ""best place for care"" and that is the ""care"" I received: dismissive and incompetent. I am just going to live for as long as I can, the way I want to live. No more tests/biopsies/surgeries. I am done."
"Dear All,

The Unit itself looks, rather like, the Oxygen Monitors that are put onto your Thumbs..... except this is put on your Toe(s).

I soaked them for about Fifteen minutes, before carefully drying- taking care to ensure a Good Drying. I then placed the Machine (for want of a better word) over my Big Toe- the infected one- and pushed the Start Button. A Green 'In Use' light came on, on top of the unit. There was a Slight 'Tingling' sensation, as the Unit operated- apparently Giving Off both Blue 'Visible' and Red 'Invisible' Light. The Product Stopped Automatically, after seven minutes- the Treatment was then Complete. I then covered my toes in Anti Fungal Cream, before putting on Night Socks (Sox, for our American Cousins).
I have only 'Done' this a few times, with very little After Effect- maybe a Very Slight 'burning' sensation but Really NOTHING to worry about. I'm Going to continue, with this, for some weeks, and 'see' what Happens.

"Help, my husband and I are on a cruise, we managed to go ashore to beautiful place Cadiz. After visiting Cadiz we had a sea day but my husband developed a cough which upset his sleep.

Face masks x 100
Gloves x 100

People were asked to wear mask and to use the many hand washing and alcohol and very few did.
Today 13th July2022 the nurse came and took a nasal sample from my husband and me. He was negative and I am positive!!!! And so we are still in quarantine. My husband spoke to the ship‚Äôs doctor regarding Anti viral medications, he admitted that he didn‚Äôt know any about ‚ÄúChurg Strauss‚Äù and was contacting a fellow medic.
Is there anything else I should be doing and does anyone have information re anti-viral? We are currently in the Pacific Ocean and I will be limited on what to do next
Looking forward to guidance and any recommendations re anti viral.

"Hi. Nobody said this was going to be so hard. I feel like I am loosing my mind. Forgetting to do things that I should know. Cyclo drip yesterday was not the answer I was looking for. It‚Äôs got to be the prednisone that is the issue, right as I‚Äôm on so much 60 mg. Tremours and memory loss seem to be worst of it not to mention the insomnia. Any ideas? Has anyone experienced any of these? Please help me I‚Äôm only 52 and single"
"Yes, I did search this site for answers before asking this question. Yes, I did google the question, there is no answer. The answers are for extractions.
I do NOT need an extraction, I need a crown & a regular cleaning & 1 filling. All can be done with separate appointments. Dentist is amazing but will not touch teeth without consult with rheumatologist & rheumatologist is not available to see me for 4 months.
Dentist gave me a medical clearance form to have rheumatologist sign. I do not wish to lose my front teeth and am considering signing form myself as waiting 4 months is ridiculous. (I went to the rheumatologist office yesterday with no appointment. No help at all, wait for 4 month later appointment.)
I understand the issues with infection with an extraction but this is not an extraction. Not an extraction.
Has anyone on these 2 meds had cleanings with no issues?
Has anyone on these 2 meds had a filling with no issues?
Has anyone on these 2 meds had a crown with no issues?
I do not wish to lose my teeth over the ""possibility "" of an infection. The loss of the teeth is NOT a possibility, it is a definite. My teeth were cleaned every 4 months for the last 10 years. I had no dental issues and took great care of my teeth. I refuse to lose them now.

"Anyone had any problems. I have severe suppressed Immunity problems. Supported by general bloodtests and involement in Study to check effectiveness of Covid vaccines.

"Hi everybody, I submitted a post a couple of weeks ago explaining I had tested positive for Covid and the following Day I had received Monoclonal Antibody treatment (Sotrovimab) in hospital the following day. All was going well until last Sunday (3rd) when still positive I started getting body pain in my abdomen, by Sunday night they were getting worse and after no sleep on Sunday they hit a peak on Monday night, all down my right side, ribs, chest, shoulder and arms I was crying out with pain. Tuesday slightly better (tested negative) but still in a lot of pain, Wednesday again a bit better (tested negative again), yesterday another improvement and today I can actually lie on my back. I called my GP in desperation on Monday to try and get some heavy duty pain killers as I can‚Äôt take Ibuprofen so I was only taking Paracetamol. She said it could be that as I had an infusion of Rituximab in May and then Sotrovimab in June it‚Äôs like a double whammy, and it probably got into the damaged vessels caused by the GPA in 2019. Please be aware, I wouldn‚Äôt wish my experience on my worst enemy. Take care all. Nick."
I was prescribed Omeprazole when first diagnosed with Polymyalgia. Consultant agreed I could stop them a year ago. Have always taken digestive enzymes which have always helped me in the past. .

"I have been following this forum for a little while and I have found it very informative and helpfull so much so, that I thought I might put my case out there to help guide me on this journey.
In Marchy 2022, was also diagnosed with Pulmonary fibrosis as a result of the vasculities , now 75% lung capacity. Been tapering since December 2022 from 10mg daily, got to 5mg last week, but all along I have felt very tired, more brethless and have this dry cough develop. Following recent blood tests, increases to CRP and ESR as well a slight increase in the ANCA markers, and white cell count normal, my Nephrologist has told me that the Rituximab should have dramaticallt reduced the white cells, so it has had no effect on the vasculities. He has put my Prednisolone back up to 10mg to try to improve my tireness and anxiety, not sure it's working. As an alternative ( the only one offered) is Cyclophosphamide 500mg 6 x 2 weekly infusions. He is about to send me informayion on the drug and then I need to decide. I don't think I have any choice. I would appreciate very much any comments on the use of this new drug and and any personal experiences. Thank you very much."

Evusheld is a preventative antibody treatment, developed for immunosuppressed people, to try to stop them developing Covid, or developing so severely.

"I was ""officially"" diagnosed by tests, surgeries, biopsies, exams, labs, etc. in fall of 2021. At that time, Specialists' review of past 5 years of my history show symptoms of undiagnosed ANCA-vasculitis, diffuse systemic scleroderma, connective tissue disease, Hashimoto's, Raynaud's, hearing loss (right ear), GERD, CREST, lung fibrosis, heart issues, truly amazing skin infections, etc. Joint pain had been treated with steroid injections, celebrex, for YEARS and did not lessen. In early 2021, I was told ""There is nothing wrong with you, see a psychiatrist."" Best advice ever because the psychiatrist sent me to specialists and a diagnosis was made. After 25 weeks of 20 mg methotrexate wkly and 20 mg prednisone daily, the diseases are not in remission and have progressed. Recommending rituximab. Side effects on company web site sounds horrific but support groups seem to not have side effects or no where near what is reported for RA, etc. Thank you for any insight you may have into rituximab."

"I was diagnosed with EGPA I‚Äôm August last year - nasty experience as fellow EGPAers will know. After 6 nights in hospital we started off with lots of prednisolone (60 mg) and methotrexate but as we reduced the steroids I had two flares in the next two months and had to go back to 60mg. In November I managed to get myself referred to the EGPA specialist team at Guys & St Thomas (not a simple process as my GP is out of the GST catchment area - but thank you to Frimley Hospital for helping me with this).
At GST the specialist EGPA team is actually based in the Chest clinic so they are focused on the asthma part of EGPA and the management of eosinophil levels through MAB treatment. It may not be for everybody but my own experience has been amazing so far. No further flares, Pred down to 6 mg and my mountain biking level pretty much back to where it was pre August.
Just thought that I should share this experience. Wishing everyone the very best - keep positive!"
"My Dad has Vasculitis and Stage 5 kidney disease he has been on azathioprine for a number of years which has held his Vasculitis under control. He‚Äôs currently in hospital with a chest infection, They stopped his Azathioprine while he was on antibiotics which has now cleared up but his infection markers are rising. The Dr is starting him back on Azathioprine in the morning and I wondered if anyone knew how quickly it would start to kick in? As they think it‚Äôs not having it has given him a flare up? He‚Äôs desperate to come home but the Drs are dragging their feet."

"Hi everybody, I submitted a post a couple of weeks ago explaining I had tested positive for Covid and the following Day I had received Monoclonal Antibody treatment (Sotrovimab) in hospital the following day. All was going well until last Sunday (3rd) when still positive I started getting body pain in my abdomen, by Sunday night they were getting worse and after no sleep on Sunday they hit a peak on Monday night, all down my right side, ribs, chest, shoulder and arms I was crying out with pain. Tuesday slightly better (tested negative) but still in a lot of pain, Wednesday again a bit better (tested negative again), yesterday another improvement and today I can actually lie on my back. I called my GP in desperation on Monday to try and get some heavy duty pain killers as I can‚Äôt take Ibuprofen so I was only taking Paracetamol. She said it could be that as I had an infusion of Rituximab in May and then Sotrovimab in June it‚Äôs like a double whammy, and it probably got into the damaged vessels caused by the GPA in 2019. Please be aware, I wouldn‚Äôt wish my experience on my worst enemy. Take care all. Nick."

It is in the Dundee city centre venue again. Just over a week after I am getting my hair cut.
I will enjoy my likely few good weeks left. I plan to recheck my antibodies before and after vaccine 5.
P.S. I‚Äôm registered with the Scottish vaccine booking system and they emailed me today about my new appointment. I expect to get an appointment letter in the post after. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on the Scottish vaccine booking system online at vacs.nhs.scot My appointment is there now."

A couple of Months ago I bought, or technically was given, a new Electric Reclining Chair- I was Sixty in February (poor old Crock!).

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."
Hi has anyone heard how lateral flow tests will be distributed to those that qualify after April 1st ? It‚Äôs been very quiet from government recently.
"I'm hoping someone in my situation can give me some information!
How safe am I to go out and about (within reason) - I was CEV. I have had 4 jabs, none gave me any antibodies. (Yes, tested.) A few weeks ago I caught Covid despite being super careful. As I was on an NHS priority treatment pathway I was given an infusion of Sotrovimab anticlonal antibodies in hospital. (I couldn't take the oral treatment as I'm on thyroxine for an underactive thyroid and it interacts BADLY with Paxlovid.
The nurse said I'd have a few weeks with protection and if I caught it again they would repeat the dosage.
(BTW I am so grateful as I was very poorly for two weeks and without the infusion would have ended up in hospital...).
FYI I am on 1.5grams mycophenalate & 10mg pred daily.
SO where am I now? Confused. Being careful but not sure how careful I should be - am I like a fully vaccinated person? Or not?
Well, if you make any sense of this let me know what you have heard or think!
Many thanks -"

However I am Immune Suppressed, due to BOTH Vasculitis AND a Kidney Transplant (in July 2013).Clearly IF I DO contract, this disease, I will HAVE to then contact my own Doctor As Quickly As Possible.

"I‚Äôm pretty shocked tonight. I‚Äôve been quite ill this year, spent some time in hospital, had a few trips to a and e, had multiple outpatient appointments over the last few months, my fear throughout was contracting covid when being so unwell and omicron rates were so high. I have to say that through that I was so impressed with the hospitals strict covid policies around mask wearing and precautions in place and have so far managed to avoid it.
However, I had to take my daughter to a & e today, what an awful experience, no one on the door anymore checking for covid symptoms, no requirement to wear masks, absolutely packed in there, 5 hour waiting time to see a doctor, full of people coughing, never felt so vulnerable. People clearly with covid symptoms waiting with the rest of us. Just a sign on the door saying please wear a mask if you have covid symptoms. 1 in 20 they believe have covid and mask wearing not being enforced in hospitals anymore. How on earth do they expect it not to spread like wild there.
I‚Äôm just shocked, it‚Äôs as if people like us just don‚Äôt matter, next time I need to go to hospital in an emergency I‚Äôm certainly not walking into a&e and putting myself through that.
Sorry that‚Äôs my rant, hope everyone‚Äôs ok."
I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?
"Hi .
I have GPA and I am identified as being clinically extremely vulnerable due to the fact that I take immune suppressants (Azathioprine and Prednisolone).
I recently became infected with Covid 19 and became very ill. Because I became ill on the weekend I so had to book a courier to pick up my PCR test. The call to 119 took nearly two hours to be answered and was a complete nightmare to undertake when being so ill.
I registered my condition with all the relevant departments and awaited a phone call from a doctor to assess my condition with the view to being offered one of the new treatments, (Nirmatrelvir, Ritonavir, Remdesivir, or Molnupiravir) because I am clinically extremely vulnerable.
I waited anxiously by the phone as I was told that I would receive a call from a doctor within 24 hours after registering my Covid 19 results. I was absolutely frightened to death and just wanted to speak to someone for reassurance.
The call never came and so I rang 111 for advice. 111 told me that a doctor would definitely call and I was to wait for the call.
Five days later I get a text saying ‚ÄúOur GP has reviewed your medical records and there is no indication you meet the strict criteria for treatment. We've had high volumes of referrals and our GPs are unable to speak to every patient‚Äù. Regards Covid Management Service South Worcestershire Primary Care Limited.
I did not receive a single phone call from my GP, the Rheumatology Team, the Respiratory Team, or my specialist. I have been left to live or die alone
Apparently, the conditions for receiving the new treatments have recently changed. Clinically Extremely Vulnerable people no longer qualify. I just wondered if anyone else had been refused treatment?"
"First go trying a meal with the anti tremor spoon I bought recently. It‚Äôs mainly designed for people with Parkinson‚Äôs, but can also help other neurological conditions. I have very shaky hands from cerebral vasculitis. It beeps when you plug it in! Going well so far. It‚Äôs sometimes called the Google Spoon. Eating Singapore Fried Rice tonight. It has little sensors and motors in it to adjust to reduce the effects of shaking, and to keep the spoon level. Sadly these devices are expensive, costing hundreds of pounds, and are unlikely to be provided by local occupational therapy. I bought a secondhand one on eBay for 1/3 of the usual price. This model is also not available to buy new in the UK normally. As a rechargeable device it also has a limited lifetime. But hopefully it will help me for some time to come. P.S. I didn‚Äôt eat all that üòú Generous Chinese takeaway serving!"
"Tested Positive - Got up yesterday felt a bit heady, ran my normal test and OMG - Positive. Rang my consultants admin they completed form and contacted yesterday by a snotty woman from NHS who didn‚Äôt have a clue about Vasculitis or GPA and the potential of getting seriously ill while on Rituximab. Finally she agreed to submit a prescription to the Hospital who are supposed to contact me today regarding anti viral treatment. Symptoms only slight at the mo pretty much the same as yesterday but waiting for the storm to come. Wife still negative. We were in a hotel for a few days, a horrible family were staying there, dirty kids in pyjamas at breakfast, coughing everywhere, I moved but it may have been too late. Just shows how easy it is to get it. Take care everybody."
"Hi Everybody. As the question says have you experienced being infected while on Rituximab. Please don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs part of my plan, it isn‚Äôt but I ask the question because my Consultant said to me that a recent briefing she had received indicated that Rituximab patients were prone to be the most vulnerable group if infected by Covid. Note the word ‚ÄúIndicated‚Äù. But summer is coming, I need to get out more and with antiviral drugs, more doses of the vaccine things are getting better for us. I am unbelievably careful but want to get on with my life at the same time. Everybody else is. Any experiences would be greatly appreciated. Having an idea of the risk and consequences would help.

"I have been on prednisolone for over 13 years now and I can't seem to get down. I have been told by my consultant, Mr Hughes , following a scan two years ago, that I had a residual amount of vasculitis/ giant cell arteritis in my system and I had to reduce my pred. I also had paid privately, two years ago, to speak to Prof. Dasgupta who said after 11 years of prednisolone I was definitely suffering from prednisolone toxicity and it was imperative that I got down to at least 7.5 mgs. Two years later I am worse off and seem stuck around 14 mgs. I was on 12mgs when I spoke to Prof. Gasgupta
I keep trying to drop by 0.5mgs every two weeks and have done this so many times. I get down to 10.5/11mgs and then it all goes wrong and I get my usual symptoms of tiredness, headache, light headness and generally feeling unwell. These have always been my symptoms no matter what I have tried. Of late when I get a bad spell I try and sit at 1mg above where I have just been when I got the relapse. My thinking is I don't have an illness it's just too much prednisolone in my body therefore just wait until your body adjusts. I have now been at 13.5 mgs for 9 days and I am still feeling rotten. Interestingly I did get down to 8.5mgs some years ago and my original symptoms of polymyalgia started returning i.e. sore thighs and neck etc. I had initially been diagnosed with polymyalgia for two years and that then morphed into giant cell arteritis.
If you read this far then thanks for reading. Any thoughts most welcome!!"
"Hi Everybody, I just happened to turn the news on at lunchtime yesterday and during the discussion (bun fight) regarding the PMs non compliance with Covid Rules debate a Tory MP asked the PM ‚ÄúNow that Evushield has been authorised by the MHRA in March can the Government get on with making it available so the severely immune suppressed can enjoy their summer‚Äù ? . All we go was ‚Äúwe need to follow the data‚Äù with a shot of the Health Secretary looking on and rolling his eyes like a little snake. What are they doing? Does anyone know.

"I received a letter last month (February) from Imperial College/NHS for the MELODY Study saying,
""We have chosen your name at random from a list of people who may either have a rare autoimmune disease or type of blood cancer which is usually treated with immunosuppressive treatment held by the National Disease Registration Service"".
I volunteered of course, and have received the kit and done the test.
I'm pleased to say that my test showed Positive results for the longer lasting IgG antibodies. Although this test is not 100% accurate at an individual level, I feel that it is an encouraging indicator.

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"

"Hi friends, thank you for any and all help.
I'm seeing a specialist about my kidney issues, that being low eGRF score of around 60. I had the appointment the other day, so the specialist today was, erm, concerned - he said he's seen people with muscle before without such a low eGFR.
He did have a test result that he showed me,
Protienase-3. pANCA: Positive.
Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL.
He was speaking very fast and I didn't understand him all that much, apart from he wanted to do a kidney biopsy, as he was confused with my results. I didn't have any inflamation markers, no protien in my urine, blood pressure is not... But he then said thY ippn seeing the Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL he cannot just leave it, it needs investigating. He said he's going to discuss with the rest of rhe department.
So. What does Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL actually mean, is it Vaculitis?
I cant find any information on this.
Is there a link to having an extreme allergic reaction to wheat and Vaculitis?

We've had high volumes of referrals and our GPs are unable to speak to every patient‚Äù. Regards Covid Management Service South Worcestershire Primary Care Limited.
I did not receive a single phone call from my GP, the Rheumatology Team, the Respiratory Team, or my specialist. I have been left to live or die alone
Apparently, the conditions for receiving the new treatments have recently changed. Clinically Extremely Vulnerable people no longer qualify. I just wondered if anyone else had been refused treatment?"

I know it‚Äôs only a proposal but am I missing something? This is the most frightening development I have heard for those of us who are CEV. Forgotten again? Don‚Äôt care about us. How can we live our lives not knowing we are sat somewhere and somebody near could be infected. Am I panicking? Or being a drama person. Thoughts please.
"First go trying a meal with the anti tremor spoon I bought recently. It‚Äôs mainly designed for people with Parkinson‚Äôs, but can also help other neurological conditions. I have very shaky hands from cerebral vasculitis. It beeps when you plug it in! Going well so far. It‚Äôs sometimes called the Google Spoon. Eating Singapore Fried Rice tonight. It has little sensors and motors in it to adjust to reduce the effects of shaking, and to keep the spoon level. Sadly these devices are expensive, costing hundreds of pounds, and are unlikely to be provided by local occupational therapy. I bought a secondhand one on eBay for 1/3 of the usual price. This model is also not available to buy new in the UK normally. As a rechargeable device it also has a limited lifetime. But hopefully it will help me for some time to come. P.S. I didn‚Äôt eat all that üòú Generous Chinese takeaway serving!"
"Tested Positive - Got up yesterday felt a bit heady, ran my normal test and OMG - Positive. Rang my consultants admin they completed form and contacted yesterday by a snotty woman from NHS who didn‚Äôt have a clue about Vasculitis or GPA and the potential of getting seriously ill while on Rituximab. Finally she agreed to submit a prescription to the Hospital who are supposed to contact me today regarding anti viral treatment. Symptoms only slight at the mo pretty much the same as yesterday but waiting for the storm to come. Wife still negative. We were in a hotel for a few days, a horrible family were staying there, dirty kids in pyjamas at breakfast, coughing everywhere, I moved but it may have been too late. Just shows how easy it is to get it. Take care everybody."
"Hi Everybody. As the question says have you experienced being infected while on Rituximab. Please don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs part of my plan, it isn‚Äôt but I ask the question because my Consultant said to me that a recent briefing she had received indicated that Rituximab patients were prone to be the most vulnerable group if infected by Covid. Note the word ‚ÄúIndicated‚Äù. But summer is coming, I need to get out more and with antiviral drugs, more doses of the vaccine things are getting better for us. I am unbelievably careful but want to get on with my life at the same time. Everybody else is. Any experiences would be greatly appreciated. Having an idea of the risk and consequences would help.

"Hi
I have been diagnosed with Vasculitis now for just over a year and I am still taking about twenty odd tablets per day and I know everyone says it‚Äôs going to take years to get right but‚Ä¶
I was sitting down yesterday when my wife said oh my god what have you done. I looked down and my arm was bleeding in two places. No cuts, no scratches or knocks.

"I have been on prednisolone for over 13 years now and I can't seem to get down. I have been told by my consultant, Mr Hughes , following a scan two years ago, that I had a residual amount of vasculitis/ giant cell arteritis in my system and I had to reduce my pred. I also had paid privately, two years ago, to speak to Prof. Dasgupta who said after 11 years of prednisolone I was definitely suffering from prednisolone toxicity and it was imperative that I got down to at least 7.5 mgs. Two years later I am worse off and seem stuck around 14 mgs. I was on 12mgs when I spoke to Prof. Gasgupta
I keep trying to drop by 0.5mgs every two weeks and have done this so many times. I get down to 10.5/11mgs and then it all goes wrong and I get my usual symptoms of tiredness, headache, light headness and generally feeling unwell. These have always been my symptoms no matter what I have tried. Of late when I get a bad spell I try and sit at 1mg above where I have just been when I got the relapse. My thinking is I don't have an illness it's just too much prednisolone in my body therefore just wait until your body adjusts. I have now been at 13.5 mgs for 9 days and I am still feeling rotten. Interestingly I did get down to 8.5mgs some years ago and my original symptoms of polymyalgia started returning i.e. sore thighs and neck etc. I had initially been diagnosed with polymyalgia for two years and that then morphed into giant cell arteritis.
If you read this far then thanks for reading. Any thoughts most welcome!!"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"

I'm seeing a specialist about my kidney issues, that being low eGRF score of around 60. I had the appointment the other day, so the specialist today was, erm, concerned - he said he's seen people with muscle before without such a low eGFR.
He did have a test result that he showed me,
Protienase-3. pANCA: Positive.
Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL.
He was speaking very fast and I didn't understand him all that much, apart from he wanted to do a kidney biopsy, as he was confused with my results. I didn't have any inflamation markers, no protien in my urine, blood pressure is not... But he then said thY ippn seeing the Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL he cannot just leave it, it needs investigating. He said he's going to discuss with the rest of rhe department.
So. What does Protienase-3 (Phadia) 5.10 iu/aL actually mean, is it Vaculitis?
I cant find any information on this.
Is there a link to having an extreme allergic reaction to wheat and Vaculitis?

"Hi Everybody, I just happened to turn the news on at lunchtime yesterday and during the discussion (bun fight) regarding the PMs non compliance with Covid Rules debate a Tory MP asked the PM ‚ÄúNow that Evushield has been authorised by the MHRA in March can the Government get on with making it available so the severely immune suppressed can enjoy their summer‚Äù ? . All we go was ‚Äúwe need to follow the data‚Äù with a shot of the Health Secretary looking on and rolling his eyes like a little snake. What are they doing? Does anyone know. The US and EU are using it. Just more convinced the don‚Äôt care about us. Nick"
"I received a letter last month (February) from Imperial College/NHS for the MELODY Study saying,
""We have chosen your name at random from a list of people who may either have a rare autoimmune disease or type of blood cancer which is usually treated with immunosuppressive treatment held by the National Disease Registration Service"".
I volunteered of course, and have received the kit and done the test.
I'm pleased to say that my test showed Positive results for the longer lasting IgG antibodies. Although this test is not 100% accurate at an individual level, I feel that it is an encouraging indicator.
I was also pleased to be able to contribute to the questionnaire about life and covid fears, plus effects on my mental health.
Has anybody else here been approached and done the test?"
GPA & Anaesthesia
"Diagnosed with Wegener's GPA 3 years ago, I live in Dallas Texas. I really enjoy the outdoors, riding a bicycle, motorcycle and hiking. Wegener's is becoming a challenge to my life style.
I try to remain positive. I do feel very fortunate that this disease has not been worse. I do enjoy reading other's experience with this disease."
"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"

"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid.

"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

It is in the Dundee city centre venue again. Just over a week after I am getting my hair cut.
I will enjoy my likely few good weeks left. I plan to recheck my antibodies before and after vaccine 5.

"I have received a letter from the NHS which tells me I might be suitable for anti-virals if I get Covid. I was hoping for this because I have vasculitis and take RTX which the (Octave?) study showed to be the cohort with the least protection from the vaccination programme.
I received a PCR test with a red cardboard return box. I think the red is important to identify it as a priority for anti-viral delivery. They aim to give anti-viral as promptly as possible. The idea is if you get symptoms, they rush you the meds to your home or get you to a hospital which gives you an infusion.
All I need now is to get symptoms!

Hi my name is Jay and I just wanted to introduce myself. My husband has vasculitus which has aggressively attacked his kidneys so he will need a kidney transplant once the condition is under control. At the moment he is on dialysis 3 times a week. We only found out how ill he was in November 2021 so it's been a lot to take in. I just wanted to say hello and make contact as I've been finding it tough to accept the new reality. I thought it would help to reach out and talk to people in similar situations.
"Dear All,
I 'did' my normal Local Shop, earlier on..... Ham, Chicken Slices and a few Other Odds & Ends- including a set of 'Assorted Binder Clips'. Under ¬£2 for Two Large, Three Medium and Four Small- not bad Value really.
I put the shopping 'Away', when I got home, or so I thought..... I just found the 'Clips' in the FRIDGE, with the meat......... Somehow NOT my best Memory Day- as 'they' said at School.
Must Try Harder!

So it is wonderful when I do read messages to often see that great advice and support has already been given. Thanks so much!"

"Hi
I‚Äôve just received 3 infusions of cyclophosphamide at 3 week intervals for microscopic polyangitis for which I‚Äôve had 2.5 years.
Since my first infusion I‚Äôve had a constant dull ache pain in both my liver and spleen, I‚Äôve also had 2 months of severe nausea/ sickness.
I‚Äôm currently on my 5th sickness tablets called domperidone which you can only take for 7 days.
On top of that this infusion seems to have flared 4or5 of my pre existing conditions. I either need shooting or some of you have some sound advice/guidance. Sorry for droning on.

Here is the list of groups who can still order free LFT tests in Scotland after Sunday when general free tests end.

"Can anyone who is currently on Mepolizumab or Benralizumab who are self-administering help? My wife is on Benra and has to attend the local hospital every other month to be handed the self injection pen by a nurse to administer the dose herself. She has asked repeatedly if the ‚Äòpens‚Äô could be sent to our home or she could collect them from a pharmacy but the requests have been denied. The ‚Äòreason‚Äô given is that there is no protocol in place to dispose of the used injectors. The hospital is ‚Äòriddled‚Äô with covid so it makes no sense to us to put my wife at increased risk by requiring her to go there.

Note I didn‚Äôt book this. In Scotland we‚Äôre being sent appointments. But I‚Äôve expected it any time 3-6 months after vaccine 4. The severely immunosuppressed are generally being booked earlier than 6 months.
It is in the Dundee city centre venue again. Just over a week after I am getting my hair cut.
I will enjoy my likely few good weeks left. I plan to recheck my antibodies before and after vaccine 5.
P.S. I‚Äôm registered with the Scottish vaccine booking system and they emailed me today about my new appointment. I expect to get an appointment letter in the post after. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on the Scottish vaccine booking system online at vacs.nhs.scot My appointment is there now."

"Hi,
My husband has GPA and is awaiting third vCivid vaccine. His concern is that he had both initial Covid vaccines whilst undergoing cyclophosphamide treatment snd is terrified he has no immunity to Covid. We know he will be eligible for the vaccine but so far has been unsuccessful at booking an appt for one because it‚Äôs not been 6 months since his last vaccine. Does anyone know if he will have to wait the full 6 months or could he have the antibody test to identify if he has generated a response to those vaccines he has already had? If so, where do we order a test from, and what test are we asking for? If that antibody test shows low response to the vaccines, has he an argument for receiving his 3 rd dose now?
He is currently having an immunosuppressant holiday between finishing his chemo and starting oral immunosuppressants so in our heads this would be a great time to have the vaccine booster but we are hitting brick walls when making any attempts to get one. Can anyone enlighten us? Thank you"

I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?

Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray.

"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid.

"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

Here is the list of groups who can still order free LFT tests in Scotland after Sunday when general free tests end. I‚Äôm covered phew as a severely immunosuppressed person eligible for the antiviral drugs. And amazingly so is my husband as my unpaid carer (registered with my GP). Not all immunosuppressed people qualify. It is medication dependent. See nhsinform.scot/illnesses-an... Relevant patients should ideally have received a letter about this from the NHS at the start of the year. Anyway some good news for some. Sharing this for info.
How long after the 3rd vaccine do we get the booster please? Are there any official notices?
"Hi,
My husband has GPA and is awaiting third vCivid vaccine. His concern is that he had both initial Covid vaccines whilst undergoing cyclophosphamide treatment snd is terrified he has no immunity to Covid. We know he will be eligible for the vaccine but so far has been unsuccessful at booking an appt for one because it‚Äôs not been 6 months since his last vaccine. Does anyone know if he will have to wait the full 6 months or could he have the antibody test to identify if he has generated a response to those vaccines he has already had? If so, where do we order a test from, and what test are we asking for? If that antibody test shows low response to the vaccines, has he an argument for receiving his 3 rd dose now?
He is currently having an immunosuppressant holiday between finishing his chemo and starting oral immunosuppressants so in our heads this would be a great time to have the vaccine booster but we are hitting brick walls when making any attempts to get one. Can anyone enlighten us? Thank you"
"vasculitis.org.uk/news/covi...
This page on the VUK website gives information about boosters AND third vaccines, if you are using a mobile phone make sure you scroll down and read the whole page?"

"I‚Äôm pretty shocked tonight. I‚Äôve been quite ill this year, spent some time in hospital, had a few trips to a and e, had multiple outpatient appointments over the last few months, my fear throughout was contracting covid when being so unwell and omicron rates were so high. I have to say that through that I was so impressed with the hospitals strict covid policies around mask wearing and precautions in place and have so far managed to avoid it.
However, I had to take my daughter to a & e today, what an awful experience, no one on the door anymore checking for covid symptoms, no requirement to wear masks, absolutely packed in there, 5 hour waiting time to see a doctor, full of people coughing, never felt so vulnerable. People clearly with covid symptoms waiting with the rest of us. Just a sign on the door saying please wear a mask if you have covid symptoms. 1 in 20 they believe have covid and mask wearing not being enforced in hospitals anymore. How on earth do they expect it not to spread like wild there.
I‚Äôm just shocked, it‚Äôs as if people like us just don‚Äôt matter, next time I need to go to hospital in an emergency I‚Äôm certainly not walking into a&e and putting myself through that.
Sorry that‚Äôs my rant, hope everyone‚Äôs ok."
I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?

"Here is an update today from the Scottish Chief Medical Officer explaining the plans for both the booster and also the third primary vaccine (not booster) for severely immunosuppressed people.

I might have preferred the severely immunosuppressed primary vaccine info to be in a separate communique, but maybe wrapped up this way is going to work better.

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity.

On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

Here is the list of groups who can still order free LFT tests in Scotland after Sunday when general free tests end. I‚Äôm covered phew as a severely immunosuppressed person eligible for the antiviral drugs. And amazingly so is my husband as my unpaid carer (registered with my GP). Not all immunosuppressed people qualify. It is medication dependent. See nhsinform.scot/illnesses-an... Relevant patients should ideally have received a letter about this from the NHS at the start of the year. Anyway some good news for some. Sharing this for info.
How long after the 3rd vaccine do we get the booster please? Are there any official notices?
"Hi my granddaughter has been having immune system problems for the last 6 months or more, up to great almondstreet hospital, our local hospital, backwards and forwards to the doctor, at last she has had an Anca test which I suggested she should have and if it was positive then hopefully she could get an appointment at addenbrooke's, the test results came back but can not understand them, could anyone help please,"
"I‚Äôm pretty shocked tonight. I‚Äôve been quite ill this year, spent some time in hospital, had a few trips to a and e, had multiple outpatient appointments over the last few months, my fear throughout was contracting covid when being so unwell and omicron rates were so high. I have to say that through that I was so impressed with the hospitals strict covid policies around mask wearing and precautions in place and have so far managed to avoid it.
However, I had to take my daughter to a & e today, what an awful experience, no one on the door anymore checking for covid symptoms, no requirement to wear masks, absolutely packed in there, 5 hour waiting time to see a doctor, full of people coughing, never felt so vulnerable. People clearly with covid symptoms waiting with the rest of us. Just a sign on the door saying please wear a mask if you have covid symptoms. 1 in 20 they believe have covid and mask wearing not being enforced in hospitals anymore. How on earth do they expect it not to spread like wild there.
I‚Äôm just shocked, it‚Äôs as if people like us just don‚Äôt matter, next time I need to go to hospital in an emergency I‚Äôm certainly not walking into a&e and putting myself through that.
Sorry that‚Äôs my rant, hope everyone‚Äôs ok."
"Hi, I don‚Äôt normally post as feel a bit shy about asking for advice, but I am just interested in knowing anyone else‚Äôs experience. I have since my diagnosis, tried to do some exercise each day, however little. I thought, and I have seen on this site, that there are advocates for exercise as reducing the effects from vasculitis; I think a study was even done about the benefits of it. What I am curious about, is I never seem to get any fitter in fact last 2 weeks I have barely been able to walk as my legs have felt like lead, breathing heavily, heart racing and feeling light headed, so not sure if doing more harm than good. It‚Äôs always a bit dispiriting as never seem to get further forward and I just wondered if other people with vasculitis GPA have the same issues. I still have low level raised ANCA, also my feet and joints suffer so I can barely stand as it‚Äôs so painful. I just get so frustrated as want to push myself to feel better, but always seem to go 2 steps forward and 4 steps back! I was diagnosed in 2016 after 2 years of misdiagnosis, I have 10 to 15% scaring into lungs and I still in 10mg of pred a day as having to slowly reduce as feel so Ill if reduce too quickly. I see others on here saying they have run marathons etc and I feel a bit rubbish as it takes all my effort and energy to do the bits I try to do each day! I would really appreciate other people experience or advice. Thanks üòä"
I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."
Is anyone suffering an outbreak of hives that just won't go away? I've had severe hives for over 3 weeks now and the itching is driving me insane. I've taken Piriton but that only gives me a couple of hours relief. Please HELP!
I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

"I'm due to return to work, as I am taking both Prednisolone and Azathioprine I'm in the high risk sector. I really don't feel safe in returning, but need to do something for financial reasons.

Keep safe all!"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."
Is anyone suffering an outbreak of hives that just won't go away? I've had severe hives for over 3 weeks now and the itching is driving me insane. I've taken Piriton but that only gives me a couple of hours relief. Please HELP!
I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

Here is the list of groups who can still order free LFT tests in Scotland after Sunday when general free tests end. I‚Äôm covered phew as a severely immunosuppressed person eligible for the antiviral drugs. And amazingly so is my husband as my unpaid carer (registered with my GP). Not all immunosuppressed people qualify. It is medication dependent. See nhsinform.scot/illnesses-an... Relevant patients should ideally have received a letter about this from the NHS at the start of the year. Anyway some good news for some. Sharing this for info.
How long after the 3rd vaccine do we get the booster please? Are there any official notices?

"Hi my granddaughter has been having immune system problems for the last 6 months or more, up to great almondstreet hospital, our local hospital, backwards and forwards to the doctor, at last she has had an Anca test which I suggested she should have and if it was positive then hopefully she could get an appointment at addenbrooke's, the test results came back but can not understand them, could anyone help please,"
"I asked my GP to refer me to Prof Justin Mason in London as advised by a few of you on here. Prof Mason accepted my referral and I saw him the other day. He is so nice and extremely knowledgable with TAK.
He is now taking over my treatment plan and managing my support hub.
He put me at ease and answers so many questions. There is light at the end of the tunnel, even if it might take 5 years at a time.
Thank you to everyone who suggested him."

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."
Is anyone suffering an outbreak of hives that just won't go away? I've had severe hives for over 3 weeks now and the itching is driving me insane. I've taken Piriton but that only gives me a couple of hours relief. Please HELP!
I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail.

My reduction plan has been very gradual and have gone down preds slowley, I was on 2.5 mg for 4 weeks before stopping.

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"Dear All,
I'm sure that you have had some Scams recently.... However if you receive one from Someone Pretending To be TESCO they have a 'dedicated' Fraud Web Site. It can be found at ""physhing@tesco.com"" (don't use the quotes, that's just for clearity). You, almost certainly, Won't get a reply but you might just help STOP a scammer- before (s)he 'empties' someone's account! For the few minutes it takes, to send an Email, surely this is Worth It.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."
Is anyone suffering an outbreak of hives that just won't go away? I've had severe hives for over 3 weeks now and the itching is driving me insane. I've taken Piriton but that only gives me a couple of hours relief. Please HELP!
I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.
Many Thanks

"Dear All,
I'm sure that you have had some Scams recently.... However if you receive one from Someone Pretending To be TESCO they have a 'dedicated' Fraud Web Site. It can be found at ""physhing@tesco.com"" (don't use the quotes, that's just for clearity). You, almost certainly, Won't get a reply but you might just help STOP a scammer- before (s)he 'empties' someone's account! For the few minutes it takes, to send an Email, surely this is Worth It.
Does anyone else know, of any other, 'Dedicated Fraud Sites'?

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."
Is anyone suffering an outbreak of hives that just won't go away? I've had severe hives for over 3 weeks now and the itching is driving me insane. I've taken Piriton but that only gives me a couple of hours relief. Please HELP!
I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.

"Hi,
My husband has GPA and is awaiting third vCivid vaccine. His concern is that he had both initial Covid vaccines whilst undergoing cyclophosphamide treatment snd is terrified he has no immunity to Covid. We know he will be eligible for the vaccine but so far has been unsuccessful at booking an appt for one because it‚Äôs not been 6 months since his last vaccine. Does anyone know if he will have to wait the full 6 months or could he have the antibody test to identify if he has generated a response to those vaccines he has already had? If so, where do we order a test from, and what test are we asking for? If that antibody test shows low response to the vaccines, has he an argument for receiving his 3 rd dose now?
He is currently having an immunosuppressant holiday between finishing his chemo and starting oral immunosuppressants so in our heads this would be a great time to have the vaccine booster but we are hitting brick walls when making any attempts to get one. Can anyone enlighten us? Thank you"

"I‚Äôm pretty shocked tonight. I‚Äôve been quite ill this year, spent some time in hospital, had a few trips to a and e, had multiple outpatient appointments over the last few months, my fear throughout was contracting covid when being so unwell and omicron rates were so high. I have to say that through that I was so impressed with the hospitals strict covid policies around mask wearing and precautions in place and have so far managed to avoid it.
However, I had to take my daughter to a & e today, what an awful experience, no one on the door anymore checking for covid symptoms, no requirement to wear masks, absolutely packed in there, 5 hour waiting time to see a doctor, full of people coughing, never felt so vulnerable. People clearly with covid symptoms waiting with the rest of us. Just a sign on the door saying please wear a mask if you have covid symptoms. 1 in 20 they believe have covid and mask wearing not being enforced in hospitals anymore. How on earth do they expect it not to spread like wild there.
I‚Äôm just shocked, it‚Äôs as if people like us just don‚Äôt matter, next time I need to go to hospital in an emergency I‚Äôm certainly not walking into a&e and putting myself through that.
Sorry that‚Äôs my rant, hope everyone‚Äôs ok."
"Hi, I don‚Äôt normally post as feel a bit shy about asking for advice, but I am just interested in knowing anyone else‚Äôs experience. I have since my diagnosis, tried to do some exercise each day, however little. I thought, and I have seen on this site, that there are advocates for exercise as reducing the effects from vasculitis; I think a study was even done about the benefits of it. What I am curious about, is I never seem to get any fitter in fact last 2 weeks I have barely been able to walk as my legs have felt like lead, breathing heavily, heart racing and feeling light headed, so not sure if doing more harm than good. It‚Äôs always a bit dispiriting as never seem to get further forward and I just wondered if other people with vasculitis GPA have the same issues. I still have low level raised ANCA, also my feet and joints suffer so I can barely stand as it‚Äôs so painful. I just get so frustrated as want to push myself to feel better, but always seem to go 2 steps forward and 4 steps back! I was diagnosed in 2016 after 2 years of misdiagnosis, I have 10 to 15% scaring into lungs and I still in 10mg of pred a day as having to slowly reduce as feel so Ill if reduce too quickly.

I have EGPA and been on benralizumab for 2 years which has controlled the production of eosinophils but EGPA was still very active. After a hospital admission 18 months ago mycophenolate to little effect was added and this was increased by 50% for the last 6wks. I am still needing regular large courses of steroids to control things. Specialist now talking of adding rituxumab. But I am concerned about the possibility damage that may happen from rituxumab . My lung function off steroids is only 25-30% so any further decrease would not be good. Anyone else had issues with rituxumab and lung issues for EGPA?

Lately I had nose bleeding (one lasted for an hour) and also bad conjunctivitis in one of the eyes for 2month ,what didn't go away with increasing the dose. The doctor wants me to change the medication to Rituximab infusions. Has anyone had a similar experience? I am a bit concerned . It seems quite early for a relapse and I feel it is back to square one. How is your experience of Rituximab ?and how are you coping with going into hospital when you should be shielding.
Many thanks !"
"I'm newly registered here and wanted to say hello to everyone. I was diagnosed with GPA in August 2019 after a good few years of various problems. It's pretty systemic, with sinus, lung, skin, renal, skin and (newly acquired) heart problems. In clinical remission as of Dec 2019 so moved on to azathioprine but struggling to get BP and heart rate under control."

"Here is an update today from the Scottish Chief Medical Officer explaining the plans for both the booster and also the third primary vaccine (not booster) for severely immunosuppressed people. So hopefully Scottish GPs and consultants etc will be a bit clearer about things. I‚Äôm happier personally now there seems to be a plan that‚Äôs being communicated! I might have preferred the severely immunosuppressed primary vaccine info to be in a separate communique, but maybe wrapped up this way is going to work better.

"I asked my GP to refer me to Prof Justin Mason in London as advised by a few of you on here. Prof Mason accepted my referral and I saw him the other day. He is so nice and extremely knowledgable with TAK.
He is now taking over my treatment plan and managing my support hub.
He put me at ease and answers so many questions. There is light at the end of the tunnel, even if it might take 5 years at a time.
Thank you to everyone who suggested him."

"I‚Äôve had Cerebral Vasculitis which has now been in remission for 10yrs and still have memory problems but I‚Äôm becoming confused and it‚Äôs harder to organise anything things. I still have the occasional petit-mal seizure and I‚Äôm only going to out if I know I can get to a toilet quickly and that‚Äôs due to a few problems that‚Äôve occurred.
When I went to an important event like my wife‚Äôs presentation for her Majors and I was just in the audience with many others and I became stressed which caused a seizure and that‚Äôs happened a few times when I become very stressed. I‚Äôve become depressed and anxious so could the Cerebral Vasculitis now be Cerebral Dementia."
"Hi. I apparently I have the above medical condition but in all honestly they admit they are not sure what I have. I have had every test imaginable but still not sure. I also suffer with Asthma, Osteoporosis, Blood pressure and am currently taking an unbelievable amount of pills. I have been on Prednisolone for a year and during this time I have taken some very heavy doses of 60 mg and 45 mgs. I have had the first infusion of Rutiximab but then I got Shingles and they are loath to give me the second infusion. I have clots on the lung and I am now anaemic. I really don't know where to go from here.
I have been treated in the local hospital but I'm wondering if anyone could recommend an outstanding consultant in Vasculitus 'cos I need someone who really specialises in this particular area. Thanks so much"
"Hi, I've been on Azathioprine for nearly two years now after chemo infusions for my anti gbm vasculitus. My consultant is starting to reduce my doses monthly....I'm wondering if anyone has ever got completely off it and if they had any with-drawals or side effects etc. I'm excited at the prospect of not having to take it but also worried about it if that's makes sense!

"In early March I caught the flu. I completely lost my appetite. I didn't want to eat anything. On March 8th I felt so bad that I requested a home visit from the GP. She said that this year in the local community the flu seemed to be worse in the patients who had had the flu jab. She prescribed Tamiflu. This was the worst I have ever felt from the flu virus. Five days later on a slow recovery I had a GPA flare up.
I was in a sorry state. I couldn't co-ordinate my movements properly and I had a bad chest infection. Sent for GP who organised an ambulance and so to St James' Hospital. Five days of tests and drugs, and I began to feel better.
I still had a lot of phlegm on my lungs and I was continually coughing it up. In the previous weeks I had been using a Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) device called an 'Acapella' to help clear the phlegm. It worked after a fashion but not very deeply. While in hospital I was seen by a Physiotherapist who wanted to try another PEP device. This was a 'Pari-o-Pep' mucus device. Both these devices work on the same principle. As you blow into it, the device raises a steel ball to stop the air flow from your lungs, this allows the phlegm to drop back and then the ball releases and the air flow is restarted. This is a very quick vibrationary movement and it causes the phlegm to be dislodged and to move up the airways.
I think my Physiotherapist got a bit carried away; she kept telling me to blow harder and harder and then to cough. I started coughing and couldn't stop. It became uncontrollable. I was coughing up some phlegm, but more to the point, I had just had my lunch and I vomited. So I was uncontrollably coughing phlegm and vomiting at the same time. This went on for about five minutes before I could stop, by which time I had pulled the rib muscles in my chest on both sides, and I couldn't get a proper breath. The pain was pretty bad. The Physio made a discreet exit saying we would continue tomorrow!
The outcome of this was that I suffered from breathlessness. It feels as though a large piece of phlegm had moved up my main airway only to become lodged somewhere in my mid-chest.
Due to my 'reduced' appetite I had lost one and a half stone. I was put on a high calorie diet, but I didn't want anything. Eating for the sake of eating without pleasure is not nice.
Although my breathlessness was still there, my blood oxygen level was ok (for me) and I was discharged feeling a lot better.
During the intervening weeks until present day I have struggled with the breathlessness. I have seen an ENT surgeon with possible thoughts of stretching the trachea, but to no account. The surgeon said that with the condition of my vocal cords, no repair strategy is without a lot of risk. So no relief there. I am trying to come to terms that it could be like this for the rest of my life."
"I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs me and believe me it‚Äôs great news of lifting restrictions on July 19th I.e. Social Distancing and Facemasks well for those who aren‚Äôt clinically vulnerable that is, but what about us? Maybe I am being paranoid but cases are rising although hospital admissions are down and there is doubt on the efficiency of the COVID jabs for us so as life moves on the Doctors have said cases will continue to rise it‚Äôs inevitable it will find its way to us but not because of our carelessness. Have the clinically extremely vulnerable because of immune suppressants just been left to hide away. It feels like it to me. Anybody share this view?"
I have had Iga vasculitis for about 18 years. Swollen feet and ankles and constant pain in my joints. I take colchicine and dapson for this condition and also warfarin for a replaced aortic valve. Please can someone tell me if it is safe to take the Covid vaccine. I will be getting the Astra Zeneca one in India. There are so many opinions that I am confused and thought it would be best to ask on this group.

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

I have however had some behavioural concerns, over the last week or so I have felt agitated, i feel restless and I have been a little bit short tempered and snapped at my wife a couple of times for no good reason.
My reduction plan has been very gradual and have gone down preds slowley, I was on 2.5 mg for 4 weeks before stopping.
Has anyone else experienced this's and is this an expected behaviour of coming of preds

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

"Hi!
I have these red spots on my legs every time I have long flights. Lately, it became horrendous since they appeared again when I wore tight jeans. I went to an internal medicine doctor who referred me to a Dermatologist and Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist doctor did not pay attention to me as he was the medical director of the hospital and busy. He just ordered lab investigations every now and then. How many blood investigations he will order before he will pay attention to it. I went to a dermatologist and she saw the red spots. All my laboratory results: CBC, COagulation, ESR, Hepa Profile, Chemistry, Urinalysis,Chest X-ray, Liver Enzymes were normal. Only D-Dimer was high and Vit D was low. She diagnosed me of Cutaneous Vasculitis. Prescribed steroids and colchicine. It was effective. But when she stopped they started to pop up again whenever I stand and sit longer for a period of time. These past few days I am worried since I have kids. Is there any natural remedy for this?"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.

So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"
"Dear All,
like a lot of us, who are Immune Suppressed, I get Toe Nail Fungus which causes both 'discolouration', and 'toughness' of the nail. My Dermatologist isn't too 'worried', about it, but it is beginning to spread to other nails. Can anyone Recommend a Topical Treatment, that has 'worked' for them please?
I have ANCA Vasculitis, have had a Kidney Transplant- way back in July 2013- and am on a Cocktail of Drugs, to both prevent Rejection and control my Vasculitis. I know that this IS 'Quite An Ask' but any advice, anyone can give me, would be much appreciated.

"I had got myself into a good position with my ANCA marker after Cyclophosphamide and Prednisolone and after monthly blood tests it‚Äôs started to creep up from 40 to 51 to 62. Not a massive increase and no returning symptoms. The last blood test results for ANCA was early August because I had to go local for blood tests in September and they cocked it up. Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

I have been diagnosed with GPA. Does anyone have experience with a Truxima infusion?
"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

Anyway my point is folks it was only a week before my last ANCA Test my specialist put my Azathioprine dose up from 100mg per day to 150mg. So my questions are:
1/ Is a week too early between increase in dose and test to see a difference?
2/ Has anybody had instances where Azathioprine just doesn't work?
3/ Am I being over optimistic re timescales.
My Specialist doesn't seem worried but I am not due to see her and have my bloods done until 12th Oct so I have taken things into my own hands and got my GP yesterday to book me an ANCA Test for next week, the results will then be available for my specialist when I go in October. It will be 8 weeks between ANCA tests so I am hoping for positive news. All my other bloods I.e Kidney, Liver, Haemoglobin are spot on. It‚Äôs chaos at the hospital where my specialist is now because Covid is taking over again."

"I tested positive on February 1st by LFT and sent off my priority PCR. I have GPA plus Mycobacterium Avium complex so my lungs are not in the best shape. I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
"Hi All
Well I'm feeling a little miserable after receiving my covid antibody test result with a reading of just 4 u/ml after 3 vaccines.
Further more a recent blood test showed very suppressed CD19 levels, I've been researching this online to understand the significance and believe the low levels are the result of rituximab infusions and B cell depletion but would be really interested if anyone has had this explained to them in simple terms by their specialist.
I have been having rituximab throughout the pandemic but having half doses every 6 months because of covid and was due to have my next dose soon but have been told it won't go ahead now due to the low CD19 levels.
My main concern is that it means my immune system is very depleted at the moment or is it good that the level is low and it shows that rituximab is working. I would welcome anyone's understanding of the significance of this particular blood result.
Thanks All"

"Hi my granddaughter has been having immune system problems for the last 6 months or more, up to great almondstreet hospital, our local hospital, backwards and forwards to the doctor, at last she has had an Anca test which I suggested she should have and if it was positive then hopefully she could get an appointment at addenbrooke's, the test results came back but can not understand them, could anyone help please,"
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with vasculitis. We‚Äôre still unsure of what kind. Or if there‚Äôs an underlying co-morbity. My calf‚Äôs were hurting really bad at night but now I‚Äôm having severe toe pain and locking and then cramping of my toe joints. It‚Äôs usually at night although I have during day to. On vacation so probably won‚Äôt go see my doctor for a few weeks. Anyone ever had this and what can I do?
"Hi, I‚Äôve recently got access to my full records on Patient Access . In July 2020 I had a lot of blood tests done as I was being being checked for POTS, and I didn‚Äôt know about some of them which I think are also used for investigating vasculitis:
Myeloperoxidase MPO - 3.2
Proteinase 3 - 2.3
There were no ranges and no ANCA test was done this time. It could be because I was tested for this in 2018 and it was negative. But looking on Google I think the usual range for MPO is >3.5 for equivocal and >5 for positive. For Proteinase 2-3 is equivocal and > 3 is positive. So I‚Äôm equivocal for Proteinase and close to it for MPO, but technically negative. But what does that mean? Would you need both to be firmly positive to be sure it‚Äôs vasculitis? I know with thyroid levels that being close to the top or bottom of the range can mean something, but is it the same with this? I‚Äôd just like to know your thoughts please whether these results are helpful or not?
I met with the Rheumatologist yesterday and had lots of blood taken and a chest x-ray. She thinks it‚Äôs possible I have vasculitis, and is checking for other things too as thinks there‚Äôs likely to be a circulation problem as she noticed livedo reticular on my legs too (which I thought was just normal) and my swollen hand is very bad at the moment and I can‚Äôt bend 2 fingers or use my hand properly.
Thanks for your help!"

Hi all i was diagnosed with ANCA Vasculitis which left me with Stage 3/4 CKD and following other treatments and medication i have been given rituximab 3 times now over 18 months and due another batch in June this year.I am 67 and recentley had to have a Tumor removed from my bladder this week which was seen early.Now i am aware of side effects of Rituximab but i just wondered if anybody had similar experience and peoples views on this.
"Hi I was diagnosed with EGPA in the Brompton year ago after a week there in IV steroids. I went for a second opinion as my treating hospital wouldn‚Äôt listen to me when I said my declining health and lung function was not just asthma. I have have many annoying other EGPA related symptoms such as nasal polyps removed twice. Post discharge I was on 50mg pred which failed to keep my eosinophils down. Eventually (back at my local hospital- how still haven‚Äôt confirmed my diagnosis one way or the other) and after a year on 20-40mg pred, 3months on Mepo(which made my breathing much worse), I was given 80mg of triamcinilone and started Azathioprine. I have been much better now for 6weeks and hope that I may now be in remission. It has been decided I think that oral steroids do not work well for me ( I told many consultants that they are not effective for my severe asthma often in the last 20 plus years and finally they have seen the light and agreed!) I am ANCA negative which seems to make the god like consultants think that the EGPA diagnosis from London be wrong. I am very frustrated but have decided , after advice from my GP, my asthma specialist in my local hospital and the Brompton that I should not worry about the possible difference of opinion in the diagnosis, and focus on the treatment I am getting. It seems my lungs and gut are most likely to be worse affected, although I jget lots of vision problems and there is some damage shown on my brain scan. I try to keep positive, exercise as much as I can and am still working full time although this is getting much harder to manage. BTW my symptoms and high eosinophils seemed to have been triggered following a pneumothorax sustained by poor care in my local hospital during an asthma event- not sure it this could have triggered things??"

"As I had the chickungunya virus, bitten by an Aedes aegyti mosquito carrying the virus while in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, I got to wondering if It was the cause of my current problems; primarily musculoskeletal and fatigue. So I took some time to research this issue. This virus was never seen in the Caribbean until late 2013 and was in epidemic proportion by 2014, the year I was bitten. Much has been learned about the effects of this virus since the epidemic in the French Reunion Islands.
To keep it brief, the effects are very much like the symptoms many of us have in this group, and can become chronic in the older population..60+. The virus is virtually global . The treatments are guess what? Corticosteroids, medication for neuropathic pain, methotrexate with folic acid, calcium and immune -modulating drugs and the family of of drugs in which Rituxan falls; duration and dose determined by severity and symptoms. Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are the primary chronic symptoms with impaired quality of life.
When a person has had the virus, and blood tests do not match up with symptoms, and there is no alternative diagnosis, the virus is confirmed to have a long term impact on physical and mental health. Thirty months after acute infection, symptoms are still present in some cases.
Corticosteroids and methotrexate with physical therapy for the long term is the maintenance standard. The symptoms do seem to lessen over time.
Unfortunately, only physicians as well as rheumatologists and other specialists who practice in tropical areas are knowledgeable. It is now a global virus. It mimics vasulitis and other autoimmune diseases. The question of whether people can recover to a pre-chickungunya state is still unanswered in the 60+ population."

Does anyone know if it is possible to have normal bloods and be in remission but still feel really tired and have aching legs after walking up the stairs??
"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"
"This was published by the government today.
I would say it is quite good news, but please have in mind that
*the data used is Real World Data (derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, etc), not from clinical trials researching about the efficacy of the vaccines in specific immunocompromised groups.
*As CEV have been shielding/being very careful the data don't represent the whole picture. The actual exposure would be much lower than the rest of the population making efficacy appear higher artificially.
* It is not clear if the data collected includes data since the Delta variant came to UK or was it collected before?
Please, be happy about the good news, but as the results from research looking specifically on people either having vasculitis or having similar treatment as us will come later in the year, be careful out there. The pandemic is not over yet.

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.

"Hello,
I‚Äôve been on a reduced dose of hydroxy for urticarial vasculitis for a couple of months and am working up to a full dose.
However I‚Äôve started to feel really sore under the skin and have a throbbing head and a sore stomach. It just generally doesn‚Äôt make me feel good and a bit tired.

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."

My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength.

"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"
"This was published by the government today.
I would say it is quite good news, but please have in mind that
*the data used is Real World Data (derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, etc), not from clinical trials researching about the efficacy of the vaccines in specific immunocompromised groups.
*As CEV have been shielding/being very careful the data don't represent the whole picture. The actual exposure would be much lower than the rest of the population making efficacy appear higher artificially.
* It is not clear if the data collected includes data since the Delta variant came to UK or was it collected before?
Please, be happy about the good news, but as the results from research looking specifically on people either having vasculitis or having similar treatment as us will come later in the year, be careful out there. The pandemic is not over yet.

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.

My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 .

I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."

"As I had the chickungunya virus, bitten by an Aedes aegyti mosquito carrying the virus while in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, I got to wondering if It was the cause of my current problems; primarily musculoskeletal and fatigue. So I took some time to research this issue. This virus was never seen in the Caribbean until late 2013 and was in epidemic proportion by 2014, the year I was bitten. Much has been learned about the effects of this virus since the epidemic in the French Reunion Islands.
To keep it brief, the effects are very much like the symptoms many of us have in this group, and can become chronic in the older population..60+. The virus is virtually global . The treatments are guess what? Corticosteroids, medication for neuropathic pain, methotrexate with folic acid, calcium and immune -modulating drugs and the family of of drugs in which Rituxan falls; duration and dose determined by severity and symptoms. Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are the primary chronic symptoms with impaired quality of life.
When a person has had the virus, and blood tests do not match up with symptoms, and there is no alternative diagnosis, the virus is confirmed to have a long term impact on physical and mental health. Thirty months after acute infection, symptoms are still present in some cases.
Corticosteroids and methotrexate with physical therapy for the long term is the maintenance standard. The symptoms do seem to lessen over time.
Unfortunately, only physicians as well as rheumatologists and other specialists who practice in tropical areas are knowledgeable. It is now a global virus. It mimics vasulitis and other autoimmune diseases. The question of whether people can recover to a pre-chickungunya state is still unanswered in the 60+ population."

I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement.

Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)

"Hi I was diagnosed with EGPA in the Brompton year ago after a week there in IV steroids. I went for a second opinion as my treating hospital wouldn‚Äôt listen to me when I said my declining health and lung function was not just asthma. I have have many annoying other EGPA related symptoms such as nasal polyps removed twice. Post discharge I was on 50mg pred which failed to keep my eosinophils down. Eventually (back at my local hospital- how still haven‚Äôt confirmed my diagnosis one way or the other) and after a year on 20-40mg pred, 3months on Mepo(which made my breathing much worse), I was given 80mg of triamcinilone and started Azathioprine. I have been much better now for 6weeks and hope that I may now be in remission. It has been decided I think that oral steroids do not work well for me ( I told many consultants that they are not effective for my severe asthma often in the last 20 plus years and finally they have seen the light and agreed!) I am ANCA negative which seems to make the god like consultants think that the EGPA diagnosis from London be wrong. I am very frustrated but have decided , after advice from my GP, my asthma specialist in my local hospital and the Brompton that I should not worry about the possible difference of opinion in the diagnosis, and focus on the treatment I am getting. It seems my lungs and gut are most likely to be worse affected, although I jget lots of vision problems and there is some damage shown on my brain scan. I try to keep positive, exercise as much as I can and am still working full time although this is getting much harder to manage. BTW my symptoms and high eosinophils seemed to have been triggered following a pneumothorax sustained by poor care in my local hospital during an asthma event- not sure it this could have triggered things??"

"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."

My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength. She started on 65mg prednisone and is tappering down, currently on 45mg. She is also on cyclophosphamide once a month for 6 months, she has 5 to go !..
Curious to know if her foot drop will improve and will her strength come back. We have never heard of CSS untill she goes diagnosed with it, so ive been desperately searching for answers. Her rheumatologist tells us its just a waiting game and never tells us if there is a chance of her drop foot improving. Just after some success stories"

I wonder what I , as a patient , can do to help get this drug approved. Does anyone have experience with this medication?"

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."
"Hi, I'm 46 years old and suffered with RA since 1996. In the last couple of years I've had worsening issues with veins and sinus. Resulted in two surgeries. I finally went for a second opinion and new lab tests showed borderline ANCA for Wegeners. This past June I started my first round of Rituxin. In December I start round two. I too have periodic foot pain and pinching pain in the thighs. I was relieved to hear in reading other posts that I'm not alone. And I am certainly not diabetic. I'm hoping to learn from this forum and hope my experiences might help someone else out. Has anyone found relief for the foot pain?"

"Hi all, this post is full of ifs buts and maybes so I apologise in advance. Now the gloom surrounding COVID seems to be showing some signs of positivity due to vaccines etc I am planning a trip for 12 months time to visit relatives and friends in New Zealand for a month. I know that there could be travel restrictions and vaccine questions and rates of infection questions but taking all that away IF? There was some form of normality does anybody out there know what the medical situation would be for support again IF I needed some attention if there was a flare up or similar. I have seen they have a vasculitis foundation and believe they have an excellent Health System but would be interested if anybody has any information.

"Hello,
I‚Äôve been on a reduced dose of hydroxy for urticarial vasculitis for a couple of months and am working up to a full dose.
However I‚Äôve started to feel really sore under the skin and have a throbbing head and a sore stomach. It just generally doesn‚Äôt make me feel good and a bit tired.
Has anyone else experienced this? Will it pass or might it be a sign that the drug isn‚Äôt right for me?

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."
"Hi everyone,
My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength. She started on 65mg prednisone and is tappering down, currently on 45mg. She is also on cyclophosphamide once a month for 6 months, she has 5 to go !..
Curious to know if her foot drop will improve and will her strength come back. We have never heard of CSS untill she goes diagnosed with it, so ive been desperately searching for answers. Her rheumatologist tells us its just a waiting game and never tells us if there is a chance of her drop foot improving. Just after some success stories"
"I am wondering if nucala is approved as a treatment for egpa in the UK?

I wonder what I , as a patient , can do to help get this drug approved. Does anyone have experience with this medication?"

"As I had the chickungunya virus, bitten by an Aedes aegyti mosquito carrying the virus while in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, I got to wondering if It was the cause of my current problems; primarily musculoskeletal and fatigue. So I took some time to research this issue. This virus was never seen in the Caribbean until late 2013 and was in epidemic proportion by 2014, the year I was bitten. Much has been learned about the effects of this virus since the epidemic in the French Reunion Islands.
To keep it brief, the effects are very much like the symptoms many of us have in this group, and can become chronic in the older population..60+. The virus is virtually global . The treatments are guess what? Corticosteroids, medication for neuropathic pain, methotrexate with folic acid, calcium and immune -modulating drugs and the family of of drugs in which Rituxan falls; duration and dose determined by severity and symptoms. Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are the primary chronic symptoms with impaired quality of life.
When a person has had the virus, and blood tests do not match up with symptoms, and there is no alternative diagnosis, the virus is confirmed to have a long term impact on physical and mental health. Thirty months after acute infection, symptoms are still present in some cases.
Corticosteroids and methotrexate with physical therapy for the long term is the maintenance standard. The symptoms do seem to lessen over time.
Unfortunately, only physicians as well as rheumatologists and other specialists who practice in tropical areas are knowledgeable. It is now a global virus. It mimics vasulitis and other autoimmune diseases. The question of whether people can recover to a pre-chickungunya state is still unanswered in the 60+ population."

3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."

"Hello,
I‚Äôve been on a reduced dose of hydroxy for urticarial vasculitis for a couple of months and am working up to a full dose.
However I‚Äôve started to feel really sore under the skin and have a throbbing head and a sore stomach. It just generally doesn‚Äôt make me feel good and a bit tired.
Has anyone else experienced this? Will it pass or might it be a sign that the drug isn‚Äôt right for me?

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."
"Hi everyone,
My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength. She started on 65mg prednisone and is tappering down, currently on 45mg. She is also on cyclophosphamide once a month for 6 months, she has 5 to go !..
Curious to know if her foot drop will improve and will her strength come back. We have never heard of CSS untill she goes diagnosed with it, so ive been desperately searching for answers. Her rheumatologist tells us its just a waiting game and never tells us if there is a chance of her drop foot improving. Just after some success stories"
"I am wondering if nucala is approved as a treatment for egpa in the UK? It was approved in dec 2017 in the United States, but in Canada my new doctor tells me it is only approved as a treatment for asthma at 100 mg and not approved as a treatment for egpa which would require 300 mg. I have heard it has very little side effects and can eliminate the need for prednizone....or at least reduce the prednizone to a very low dose. I wonder what I , as a patient , can do to help get this drug approved. Does anyone have experience with this medication?"

"As I had the chickungunya virus, bitten by an Aedes aegyti mosquito carrying the virus while in the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, I got to wondering if It was the cause of my current problems; primarily musculoskeletal and fatigue. So I took some time to research this issue. This virus was never seen in the Caribbean until late 2013 and was in epidemic proportion by 2014, the year I was bitten. Much has been learned about the effects of this virus since the epidemic in the French Reunion Islands.
To keep it brief, the effects are very much like the symptoms many of us have in this group, and can become chronic in the older population..60+. The virus is virtually global . The treatments are guess what? Corticosteroids, medication for neuropathic pain, methotrexate with folic acid, calcium and immune -modulating drugs and the family of of drugs in which Rituxan falls; duration and dose determined by severity and symptoms. Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain are the primary chronic symptoms with impaired quality of life.
When a person has had the virus, and blood tests do not match up with symptoms, and there is no alternative diagnosis, the virus is confirmed to have a long term impact on physical and mental health. Thirty months after acute infection, symptoms are still present in some cases.
Corticosteroids and methotrexate with physical therapy for the long term is the maintenance standard. The symptoms do seem to lessen over time.
Unfortunately, only physicians as well as rheumatologists and other specialists who practice in tropical areas are knowledgeable. It is now a global virus. It mimics vasulitis and other autoimmune diseases. The question of whether people can recover to a pre-chickungunya state is still unanswered in the 60+ population."

Does anyone know if it is possible to have normal bloods and be in remission but still feel really tired and have aching legs after walking up the stairs??
"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"

"Hi all, this post is full of ifs buts and maybes so I apologise in advance. Now the gloom surrounding COVID seems to be showing some signs of positivity due to vaccines etc I am planning a trip for 12 months time to visit relatives and friends in New Zealand for a month.

"Hello,
I‚Äôve been on a reduced dose of hydroxy for urticarial vasculitis for a couple of months and am working up to a full dose.
However I‚Äôve started to feel really sore under the skin and have a throbbing head and a sore stomach. It just generally doesn‚Äôt make me feel good and a bit tired.
Has anyone else experienced this? Will it pass or might it be a sign that the drug isn‚Äôt right for me?

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."
"Hi everyone,
My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength. She started on 65mg prednisone and is tappering down, currently on 45mg. She is also on cyclophosphamide once a month for 6 months, she has 5 to go !..
Curious to know if her foot drop will improve and will her strength come back. We have never heard of CSS untill she goes diagnosed with it, so ive been desperately searching for answers. Her rheumatologist tells us its just a waiting game and never tells us if there is a chance of her drop foot improving. Just after some success stories"
"I am wondering if nucala is approved as a treatment for egpa in the UK? It was approved in dec 2017 in the United States, but in Canada my new doctor tells me it is only approved as a treatment for asthma at 100 mg and not approved as a treatment for egpa which would require 300 mg. I have heard it has very little side effects and can eliminate the need for prednizone....or at least reduce the prednizone to a very low dose. I wonder what I , as a patient , can do to help get this drug approved. Does anyone have experience with this medication?"

"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"
"This was published by the government today.
I would say it is quite good news, but please have in mind that
*the data used is Real World Data (derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, etc), not from clinical trials researching about the efficacy of the vaccines in specific immunocompromised groups.
*As CEV have been shielding/being very careful the data don't represent the whole picture. The actual exposure would be much lower than the rest of the population making efficacy appear higher artificially.
* It is not clear if the data collected includes data since the Delta variant came to UK or was it collected before?
Please, be happy about the good news, but as the results from research looking specifically on people either having vasculitis or having similar treatment as us will come later in the year, be careful out there. The pandemic is not over yet.

I've had some new symptoms over the weekend & this morning I've noticed that my right foot & ankle has blue prominent veins. I've had a cool shower & elevated my leg for a little bit but it's still there.

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."

Hi my son has also got Keratoconus which they have said is not related to the GPA vasculitis. He needs to have an operation on his eyes but had to cancel this as he had just started the methotrexate and steroids 2 weeks before and they didn't feel things were stable enough. Does anyone know much about having an operation whilst on the treatment and would he have to be completely off the drugs before they could do colllegen cross linking on his eyes? ENT specialist said he thought maybe it was due to the steroids and they would interfere with the healing process. The problem is his eyes are deteriorating and I don't think there are plans for him to come off the drugs any time soon. Any thoughts? Thank you.

Hi my son has also got Keratoconus which they have said is not related to the GPA vasculitis. He needs to have an operation on his eyes but had to cancel this as he had just started the methotrexate and steroids 2 weeks before and they didn't feel things were stable enough. Does anyone know much about having an operation whilst on the treatment and would he have to be completely off the drugs before they could do colllegen cross linking on his eyes? ENT specialist said he thought maybe it was due to the steroids and they would interfere with the healing process. The problem is his eyes are deteriorating and I don't think there are plans for him to come off the drugs any time soon. Any thoughts? Thank you.

"Hi, I understand we should shield for at least 12 weeks to protect ourselves and the system (so it can deal with the onslaught) and let the pandemic peter out. But what worries me is that the virus will not disappear and all who are at high risk of getting seriously ill now will still be at risk in 12 weeks time (at least). What I want to know is what then? We continue staying indoors / shielding until they discover the vaccine (estimate 12-18 months)? Or play Russian roulette with our lives (by then they should have enough beds and ventilators, but according to this document england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/... from NHS England ""Mechanical ventilation is especially challenging and
many of the patients with severe CTD and vasculitis are poor ITU candidates so service needs to have strong prevention strategy"".)? Any thoughts?"

I would say it is quite good news, but please have in mind that
*the data used is Real World Data (derived from electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, etc), not from clinical trials researching about the efficacy of the vaccines in specific immunocompromised groups.
*As CEV have been shielding/being very careful the data don't represent the whole picture. The actual exposure would be much lower than the rest of the population making efficacy appear higher artificially.
* It is not clear if the data collected includes data since the Delta variant came to UK or was it collected before?
Please, be happy about the good news, but as the results from research looking specifically on people either having vasculitis or having similar treatment as us will come later in the year, be careful out there. The pandemic is not over yet.

I've had some new symptoms over the weekend & this morning I've noticed that my right foot & ankle has blue prominent veins. I've had a cool shower & elevated my leg for a little bit but it's still there.

"I thought it might be helpful/ reassuring for some to write about our experience with Covid.
Last week we had visitors, they were fully vaccinated and has done a LF before their visit. We saw them outside in our garden. The next day they informed us they had Covid confirmed by positive LF. So we waited !!
3 days later my OH tested positive on his LF and sent his priority PCR off ( results received by that night) a friend said it was best to contact GP (she is a nurse as well ) for referral for antivirals which I did after taking a copy of the e-mail received. My OH was quite poorly on day 1 not being able to stand, high temperature and certainly not eating or drinking much. Very slight improvement on day 2 and 3 . We still had not heard from 111 or 119 and the GP sent another referral ( think on reflection they had ‚Äúlost ‚Äú it ) Day 4 he was rung by the hospital and booked for infusion next day ( day 5) The infusion went well and today (day 6) he is certainly making progress.
I also caught Covid but thankfully have not been ill.
He has had all 4 jabs and is on RTX, MMF and 3 mgs prednisone but has no antibodies at all. We had been so very careful for 2 years- I even left work to protect him. Think it shows how contagious this strain is. The people who visited us were well on the day and had done all we asked to protect us.
I just wanted to let people know that the antivirals were a life changer for us and we are very grateful we were able to receive them in a timely fashion.
Take care and stay safe."

I finally went for a second opinion and new lab tests showed borderline ANCA for Wegeners. This past June I started my first round of Rituxin. In December I start round two. I too have periodic foot pain and pinching pain in the thighs. I was relieved to hear in reading other posts that I'm not alone. And I am certainly not diabetic.

"Hi all, this post is full of ifs buts and maybes so I apologise in advance. Now the gloom surrounding COVID seems to be showing some signs of positivity due to vaccines etc I am planning a trip for 12 months time to visit relatives and friends in New Zealand for a month. I know that there could be travel restrictions and vaccine questions and rates of infection questions but taking all that away IF? There was some form of normality does anybody out there know what the medical situation would be for support again IF I needed some attention if there was a flare up or similar. I have seen they have a vasculitis foundation and believe they have an excellent Health System but would be interested if anybody has any information. It seems to me that if I was to travel long haul New Zealand would be a safer bet. Nick."

"Hello,
I've been on hydroxychloroquine for almost 6 months for urticarial vasculitis, although on a full dose of 400mg/day for only about 3 1/2 months, and I have yet to feel any improvement. I saw my rheumy last month and he seemed to be hopeful that it was working and I should continue but I am more sceptical.
Initially he said hydroxy or dapsone were possible treatment options and I'm now wondering whether I should switch to dapsone.
Has anyone had a similar experience with hydroxy, that took a long time to start seeing results? Or has anyone taken dapsone successfully for uv? (and if yes what were the side effects like?)
thank you so much for any advice."
"Hi everyone,
My mum was diagnosed with EGPA almost 2months ago. Thankfully the only thing affected were her nervesin her left foot cauaing foot drop and her left hand causing loss of sensation and no strength.

Curious to know if her foot drop will improve and will her strength come back. We have never heard of CSS untill she goes diagnosed with it, so ive been desperately searching for answers. Her rheumatologist tells us its just a waiting game and never tells us if there is a chance of her drop foot improving. Just after some success stories"

I wonder what I , as a patient , can do to help get this drug approved. Does anyone have experience with this medication?"

I take Azathioprine and 15 mg of Prednisolone. My Covid symptoms have been like a bad cold; sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, lower back pain and more latterly, a cough. I have been able to get out of bed and watch TV, although not much energy. Today, day 5, I had an infusion of antivirals so I‚Äôm optimistic of a speedy recovery. The process has been well organised and I even received my next priority PCR in the post today. So I hope my post is reassuring to everyone who is anxious about catching Covid. I don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take or how long immunity will last but for now I am optimistic. Take care all"
Is it advisable or beneficial to have this vaccine if you have had shingles?
